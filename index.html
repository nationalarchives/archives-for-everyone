    <h1 class="display-3">Archives for Everyone</h1>
    <h2 class="sr-only">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Four years ago we took bold decisions about the kind of institution we wanted to be.</p>
    <p>We looked our biggest challenges in the eye and chose to be outward-looking, relevant, connected. We decided to
        think
        and organise ourselves differently. We began to change the way people think about archives.</p>
    <p>We reaffirmed our leadership of the archive sector, forged new academic and research partnerships, connected with
        new
        audiences, refreshed our offer to government and led the way - globally - in thinking about digital.</p>
    <p>Our historic mission endures: to collect and preserve the record, to use our expertise and knowledge to connect
        people with their history through our unrivalled collections, and to lead, partner and support archives at home
        and
        worldwide.</p>
    <p>In 2015 we set a new course and in the four years since we have learned an enormous amount about our audiences,
        our
        capabilities and the nature of the challenges we face.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, we fully recognised our potential.</p>
    <p>Archives for Everyone is about that potential and how we will realise it</p>
    <h2 class="display-4">Archives for Everyone</h2>
    <p><span class="text-uppercase">The National Archives</span> is an essential resource for our democracy, a public
        good
        and an asset for future generations.</p>
    <p>Our conviction is that archives are for everyone, and that the archives change lives for the better. Forged
        through
        experience, this conviction tells us in our relationships with our audiences and in our leadership of the
        nation's
        archives.</p>
    <blockquote>Archives are for everyone because they are about everyone - past, present and future.</blockquote>
    <p>AS the living, growing home of our national story and most diverse audience possible, in the most innovative ways
        we
        can.</p>
    <p>To honor this obligationk, to fulfil the potential inherent in our historic mission, we must become something
        new.</p>
    <p>We must become the 21st Century national archive</p>
    <p><span>Archives Inspire</span> was the start. The last four years have brought into clearer view the defining
        features
        of the 21st Century national archive.</p>
    <div class="text-uppercase">
        <p>We now know that we must be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The inclusive archive</li>
            <li>The entrepreneurial archive</li>
            <li>The disruptive archive</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="sr-only">What we know we must be</h2>
        <h3>The inclusive archive</h3>
        <p>The inclusive archive builds trust and tears down barriers to access, participation and understanding. It
            harnesses talent from diverse backgrounds. It is bold, active and outward-looking - encountered by people
            and
            communities in unexpected places and at vital moments.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>The entrepreneurial archive</h3>
    <p>The entrepreneurial archive creates and realises value at home and across the globe. Operating flexibly and
        fearlessley, it is adept at finding and exploiting commercial, research and philantropic funding opportunities -
        opening out and promoting its collection.</p>
    <h3>The disruptive archive</h3>
    <p>The disruptive archive changes everything. Constantly adapting, it rethinks and reshapes its practice to meet its
        contemporary and future challenges. Developing new skills and exploiting emerging technology, the disruptive
        archive
        reaffirms and transforms its historic mission for the digital age, from creation to presentation.</p>
    <h2 class="display-4">Making it happen</h2>
    <p>We will not become the 21st Century national archive overnight. It will take time, focus, effort and daring.</p>
    <p>We have already begun, but now we must pick up our pace. Every choice must push us on to becoming the inclusive
        entrepreneurial and disruptive national archive of our country, and the world, needs us to be</p>
    <p>Over the next four years we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the culture and approach of The National Archive so that in all we do we better reflect and represent
            the
            society we serve
        </li>
        <li>Curate unique national moments of public inspiration and participation, including through the launch of the
            1921
            Census - the UK's larges ever online release of historical records
        </li>
        <li>Create new, inclusive and exciting spaces, physical and virtual, in which people can encounter our
            collection
            afresh - partnering with The National Archives Trust to widen the public experience and understanding of
            archives and our history
        </li>
        <li>Lead the archives sector to fulfil the vision set out in Archives Unlocked, promoting our shared values of
            trust, enrichment and openness
        </li>
        <li>Generate from our collection and expertise the cutting-edge research opportunities and commercial offers
            that
            will realise value and open out more of our collections
        </li>
        <li>Secure the future of the Government record as an essential resource for public servants and the people -
            providing legal certainty through legislation.gov and historical perspective through our collection
        </li>
        <li>Lead the world in reimagining archival practice for the 21st century, pioneering new and ethical approaches
            to
            appraisal and selection, description, digital preservation and access
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Beyond the next four years</h2>
    <p>Ahead of us lie great opportunities. Our response will transform The National Archives more profoundly than at
        any
        point since the founding of the Public Record Office in 1838.</p>
    <p>Through this new and creative approach to our historic mission and through our leadership and convening power we
        will
        pioneer a new kind of cultural and heritage institution.</p>
    <p>We will make good on our unique promise and potential as the 21st Century National Archives.</p>

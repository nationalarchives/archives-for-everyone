                    <p class="callout lead">Four years ago we took bold decisions about the kind of institution we

                    <p>We looked our biggest challenges in the eye and chose to be outward-looking, relevant, connected.
                        We
                        decided
                        to
                        think
                        and organise ourselves differently. We began to change the way people think about archives.</p>
                    <p>We reaffirmed our leadership of the archive sector, forged new academic and research
                        partnerships,
                        connected
                        with
                        new
                        audiences, refreshed our offer to government and led the way - globally - in thinking about
                        digital.</p>
                    <p>Our historic mission endures: to collect and preserve the record, to use our expertise and
                        knowledge
                        to
                        connect
                        people with their history through our unrivalled collections, and to lead, partner and support
                        archives
                        at
                        home
